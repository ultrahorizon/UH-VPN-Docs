# UH Enterprise Privacy Policy

Ultra Horizon is committed to protecting your privacy. We want you to understand what information we collect, what we don’t collect, and how we collect, use, and store information. **We do not collect logs of your activity, including no logging of browsing history, traffic destination, data content, or DNS queries. We also never store connection logs, meaning no logs of your IP address, your outgoing UH Enterprise IP address, connection timestamp, or session duration. This is fundamentally because the servers operating behind UH Enterprise are owned and controlled by user or organisation paying for the service.**

Our guiding principle towards data collection is to only collect the minimal data required to operate a world-class secure network authorisation service at scale. We designed our systems to not have sensitive data about our customers; even when compelled we cannot provide data that we do not possess.

This privacy policy will help you understand how Ultra Horizon Ltd. (“**Ultra Horizon**”, “**we**”, “**our**”, or “**us**”) collects, uses, and stores information.

## [General Information](#table-of-contents)

Ultra Horizon collects two types of information:

#### (i) Information related to your account ("personal information")

This information is only applicable if using the management interface at [https://uh-enterprise.com](https://uh-enterprise.com). For users, only utilising the functionality of UH Enterprise VPN applications, this paragraph is not applicable. 

Information is simply collected for the purpose of administering your UH Enterprise subscription, and includes your name and email address which you submit when you sign up for our Services. 

#### (ii) Aggregate Apps and UH Enterprise connection summary statistics

Ultra Horizon collects minimal information about usage In order to maintain excellent customer support and quality of service. The section below describes in detail what specific information we collect. These statistics never include anything about what the user has done with the secure network connection: no data about the contents or destinations of traffic, no DNS queries, and no IP addresses.

## [Personal Information](#table-of-contents)

Ultra Horizon collects no personal information when using our VPN Apps. The only identifier that will be processed is the one-time six digit code. This is used for redemtion of a VPN profile.

## [Connection Statistics](#table-of-contents)

We ensure that we never log browsing history, traffic destination, data content, IP addresses, or DNS queries. Therefore:

We do not know which user ever accessed a particular website or service.

We do not know which user was connected to the secure network at a specific time or which UH Enterprise server IP addresses they used.

We do not know the set of original IP addresses of a user’s computer.

Should anyone try to compel Ultra Horizon to release user information based on any of the above, **we cannot supply this information because the data doesn’t exist.**

Summary

For users of our VPN applications, we collect practically no metadata on usage. Similarly, for management users we only store a name and email address to allow unique identification of a UH Enterprise subscription.

We’ve engineered our systems to categorically eliminate storage of sensitive data. We stand by our firm commitment to our customers’ privacy by not possessing any data related to a user’s online activities.

## [Jurisdiction and Applicable Law](#table-of-contents)

Ultra Horizon’s core mission is to keep your information private. We are a registered company in the United Kingdom.

Should we receive a valid legal order from the United Kingdom High Court to release information pertaining to a user, it is important to note that **Ultra Horizon does not collect any IP addresses, browsing history, encryption keys, traffic data, or DNS queries that could be used to identify any specific user.**
