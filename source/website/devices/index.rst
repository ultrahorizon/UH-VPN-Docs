As the name suggests, UH VPN Devices represent devices that people own. This could be a mobile phone,
laptop, tablet and so on. Devices authenticate directly onto UH VPN servers and a VPN connection is then
established between a device (UH VPN client application) and a server (UH VPN Server software).

Devices are managed through the `website`_ and are contained within people to facilitate easy association
between people and their hardware.

Devices are immutable objects (cannot be modified once instantiated). This improves security by ensuring
that there is a one-to-one mapping between UH VPN devices and physical devices a person owns. The OTP field
on the person's device page indicates whether the OTP code has been redeemed by a client application.
