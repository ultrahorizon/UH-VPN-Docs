Group Administrators
====================

Premium groups can have more than one administrator. This enables multiple user accounts
to control all aspects of the group. This setup is particularly suited to environments where
more than one person is responsible for VPN operations. For example, IT engineers within a
company.

To associate or remove an administrator one must first click the |settings_icon| icon next to the appropriate
group in the `management page`_. After clicking, one is presented with a page displaying group administrators
and billing information.

Associating a new admin
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To associate a new administrator to the group one must first click the "Associate New Admin" button at the
base of the list of admins. One is then prompted for a user ID of the admin one wishes to associate. This can
be found on their `profile`_ page. Once entered, click submit and the new administrator will have access to the
group in their management page.

Deleting an admin
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It is also possible to remove administrators from a group. To do so, one needs only to click on the
|delete_icon| icon next to the admin they wish to remove.

.. note::
    It is not possible to remove oneself from the list of admins, as doing so could potentially
    leave the group with zero administrators.
