Groups
******

Groups represent the top level structure for VPN deployments. They should be named to
reflect the scenario in which a VPN deployment is being utilised. For example, if one
is creating a VPN system for a company, one may wish to name the UH VPN group after that
company.

Fundamentally, groups are containers for servers, people and devices. They also hold custom
branding attributes and billing information. Multiple groups are independent from one another
even if administered through the same user account.
