Updating Groups
===============

Groups can be updated at any point by clicking the |edit_icon| icon next to the appropriate
group in the `management page`_. After clicking, one is presented with a page similar to that
of group creation, except fields are pre-filled.

Edit the fields (described in `group creation`_) and then press the submit button to save.
